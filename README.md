# ‚öíÔ∏è Installation

Install an HTTP server and PHP on your machine then, configure your HTTP server to execute PHP

```bash
cd /srv/http || cd /var/www/html
sudo git clone https://github.com/NullBrunk/PHPMonitor
```

The program needs to get the output of certain root command, but we cannot give the root permission to the program or to the apache/nginx user cause this would constitute a lack of security.

So after installing type those commands:
```bash
cd PHPMonitor/App/Utils/info/

sudo dmidecode --type 16,17 > raminfo.txt
```


Start your HTTP servet, and go to http://127.0.0.1/PHPMonitor/
