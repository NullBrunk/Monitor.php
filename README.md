# ‚öíÔ∏è Installation

## Using docker
To get a brief overview, there is a Dockerfile here if you want to test the application locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NullBrunk/PHPMonitor
cd PHPmonitor

# Build the docker image
docker build -t phpmonitor .

# And launch it
docker run -it -p 80:80 phpmonitor
```

## Install it to monitor a server

Install an HTTP server and PHP on your machine then, configure your HTTP server to execute PHP

```bash
cd /srv/http || cd /var/www/html
sudo git clone https://github.com/NullBrunk/PHPMonitor
```

The program needs to get the output of certain root command, but we cannot give the root permission to the program or to the apache/nginx user cause this would constitute a lack of security.

So after installing type these commands:
```bash
cd PHPMonitor/App/Utils/info/

sudo dmidecode --type 16,17 > raminfo.txt
```


Start your HTTP servet, and go to http://127.0.0.1/PHPMonitor/
